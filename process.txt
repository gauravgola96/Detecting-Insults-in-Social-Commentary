The project is started from text cleaning after merging the comments 
from train and test datasets.The cleaning included removal of special 
character,contraction,lemming,stemming,removal of stopwords. The cleaned
data afterwards is used for feature extraction using Bag of words and
TF-IDF(Term frequency inverse document frequency).The feature matrix if then
used for classification of comments. Naive bayes classifier and Support
vector classifier is used for prediction.Suppost Vector Classifier 
performed better with 74.4% accuracy in validation set.
